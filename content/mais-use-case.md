# Use Case 1: Multiagency Information Sharing

Whilst we have broader ambitions for the programme as a whole, we are focussing in the first instance on a narrowly scoped set of standards designed to unblock the use of ‘Single View’ systems, as an aid to multi-agency information sharing.  

‘SingleView’ systems are those which allow a professional to see on one screen, information from multiple agencies. An example is ['Family Context'](https://www.stockport.gov.uk/news/stockport-council-to-showcase-award-winning-family-context-tool) in Stockport used by social work and child protection professinals and several regional [shared care records](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/information-governance/guidance/summary-of-information-governance-framework-shared-care-records/) used by health and care professionals.

The standards we will create include: 
- A **Data Exchange Standard** which will standardise and support *how* data is exchanged between systems
- A **Person Standard** which will standardise some of the data collected about individuals, focussing on those fields required to distinguish one person from another, and to describe relationships between people.
- The first components of a **Social Care Taxonomy** which will define key concepts in children’s and adults' social care, and how they are described, but be initially limited in scope to those concepts needed to support the core use cases for Single View systems. 

## A serious and longstanding problem
In many serious case reviews, following the death or serious injury of a child, poor information sharing between agencies that support children and families is cited as a key failing. The Independent Review of Children’s Social Care, published in 2022, highlighted technological barriers as a key contributor to challenges in multiagency information sharing, with ‘clunky’ IT systems making it difficult to surface, review and then share critical information. The national review into the deaths of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson, published in 2022, likewise drew attention to this issue. In its 2024 manifesto, the Labour party pledged to improve data sharing across services, to better support children and families who too often “fall through the cracks of public services”. 

## Solutions have long existed, but are not scaling
The most valued SingleView systems for multi-agency information sharing bring together multiagency data (e.g. Police, Housing, Primary Care, Urgent Care, CAMHS, Probation, Youth Justice, Education), and display it to frontline practitioners, helping them answer questions such as ‘who already knows this child/adult, and who can tell me more’.  

Many LAs have SingleView systems which help to address this problem. Bristol, Somerset, Liverpool, Stockport, and others are often cited as exemplars.  

There are established options for LAs to configure these systems themselves with free and open source software or with common off-the-shelf products, to buy them 'as a service’ from suppliers, or to get them through their case management system. So the reason this isn’t available in all LAs is not the lack of SingleView products, or their cost. 

The binding constraint on SingleView products spreading is the cost and difficulty of securing access to the data required to make them useful. 

## We will address the barriers to scaling existing solutions
A key issue here is that part of the work of setting up data sharing for every pair of would-be sharing partners has a bespoke element to it, seen in the work of: 
- Defining the data
- Defining how it will be exchanged between systems
- Drafting and agreeing Data Sharing Agreements and DPIAs

This is what makes agreeing and implementing these data sharing programmes – and thus getting a functioning SingleView system - unnecessarily slow, expensive, and uncertain.  

We will tackle this by agreeing data standards and interoperability standards within Social Care, and with the key partners. If we are successful, then Single View systems will be cheaper and faster to scale, so more LAs will have them, and multi-agency information sharing will be easier. Ultimately,  
- **Social workers will spend less time searching for information**, and more time on direct work
- **Children and adults at risk will be more identifiable, earlier**, leading to early intervention and better outcomes

We will not develop Single View systems or create data sharing agreements, as both already exist. Our role is to facilitate their spread.
