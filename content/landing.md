# Data and Interoperability Standards in Children’s Social Care – Programme Overview

Social Finance, the Open Data Institute and Coram are working in partnership to develop data and interoperability standards for Children's Social Care.  

This work is funded by the Department for Education (DfE) as a part of the manifesto commitment to establish a Single Unique Identifier, and secure its benefits for vulnerable children and young people.  

The creation of these standards aims to make it easier for data created in one system to be accessed and meaningfully used in another. It aims to deliver: 
- **Improved safeguarding** – with social workers in more local authorities able to look up information in partners' systems.
- **Improved analysis** – by making it easier to analyse the interaction of different services. E.g. for understanding the impact of timely CAMHS provision (or its absence) on children’s journeys into care.
- **Reduced administration** – with productivity-enhancing tools for social workers more easily able to integrate with Case Management Systems (CMS), and routine exchange and recording of notifications now easier to automate. 

We also plan to use the development of national standards as an opportunity to normalise approaches to data sharing which implement privacy by design and by default [(as per ICO guidance)](https:/ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/guide-to-accountability-and-governance/data-protection-by-design-and-default/).

This work is being delivered in close coordination with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) given the important overlaps with adult social care, and under the direction of a steering group which brings together a range of stakeholders from across the sector.


## Timescales and Initial Priorities
The programme will run for three years, by which time we will have implemented a first set of standards, and created the structures for the work to continue.  

The first standards developed will focus on two areas: 
- Multiagency Information Sharing (MAIS) 
- Placement Sufficiency Analysis 

For each of these we expect to have draft standards ready for consultation in September 2025, in preparation for piloting in January 2026. There are further details on each in the use case briefing pages of the website.

## Governance and Openness
To ensure that everyone who may be able to benefit from data standardisation can contribute to the development of the standards we aim to work as openly as possible: 

- We are establishing open working groups to advise on the scope and content of each standard and ensure they address the needs of all stakeholders.  
- We will share our standards openly as they are developed, enabling the widest audience to input to their development.
- We will publish minutes of our working group meetings to enable stakeholders to understand how decisions have been made. 

Overall project governance is through a steering group that brings together leaders from across the sector, as well as experts on standards and interoperability. It is represented in cross-government initiatives on standards governance, and in contact with related standards programmes in the NHS, criminal justice, and local government.

The Department for Education (DfE) is running a three-year programme to establish data standards and interoperability standards in children’s social care. Social Finance is leading this programme on behalf of the department. 

This work is being delivered in close coordination with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) given the important overlaps with adult social care, and under the direction of a steering board which brings together a range of stakeholders.

After an initial mobilisation phase, we are now into the development stage with two workstreams to take forward two priority Use Cases:
 - Multiagency Information Sharing (MAIS)
 - Commissioning children’s care placements.  

Each workstream will follow best practice in developing open standards for data, with an open working group in which all interested stakeholders may take part. Working groups will also make recommendations as to the implementation support required by LAs, CMS suppliers, and other stakeholders.  

### Standards brief – Multiagency information sharing 

Whilst the scope for the programme as a whole is broad, we are focussing in the first instance on the standards required to unblock the use of ‘Single View’ systems, as an aid to multi-agency information sharing. Specifically: 

- A Data Exchange Standard will standardise and support how data is exchanged between systems. 
- A Person Standard will standardise some of the data collected about individuals, focussing on those fields required to distinguish one person from another, and to identify relationships between persons.
- The first component of a Children’s Social Care Taxonomy will define key concepts in children’s social care, and how they are described, but be limited in scope to those concepts needed to support the core use cases for Single View systems. 

### Standards Brief – Commissioning children’s care placements   

We will develop a standard which: 
- Allows groups of LAs (we assume regions) to create a shared picture of placement sufficiency – what provision do they need, where, and available at what notice – and how does this compare to what they have available to the now.
- Enables them to make sufficiently like-for-like comparisons of placement cost.
- Enables them to forecast future demand for commercially meaningful types of service
- Represents the smallest possible burden on frontline staff
- Represents the smallest cost of change for regions
- Does not require any change from the case management suppliers.

We will also develop a package of implementation support for regions adopting this.

We will not be attempting to create a standard for automating any part of the placement finding process, although people working on this may find parts of the standard useful, nonetheless.

We will not be attempting to create a single national referral form, or national contract. Those might be useful, but they are distinct from this work which 
has a tighter scope – simply creating a standard for the core data to be used in sufficiency analysis. 

We will not initially be attempting to cover placements in adult social care, although the work may extend to that in future.  -->
