# Building national data standards for Children's Social Care

The Department for Education (DfE) is running a three-year programme to establish data standards and interoperability standards in children’s social care. Social Finance is leading this programme on behalf of the department. 

This work is being delivered in close coordination with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) given the important overlaps with adult social care, and under the direction of a steering board which brings together a range of stakeholders.

After an initial mobilisation phase, we are now into the development stage with two workstreams to take forward two priority Use Cases:
 - Multiagency Information Sharing (MAIS)
 - Commissioning children’s care placements.  

Each workstream will follow best practice in developing open standards for data, with an open working group in which all interested stakeholders may take part. Working groups will also make recommendations as to the implementation support required by LAs, CMS suppliers, and other stakeholders.  

### Standards brief – Multiagency information sharing 

Whilst the scope for the programme as a whole is broad, we are focussing in the first instance on the standards required to unblock the use of ‘Single View’ systems, as an aid to multi-agency information sharing. Specifically: 

- A Data Exchange Standard will standardise and support how data is exchanged between systems. 
- A Person Standard will standardise some of the data collected about individuals, focussing on those fields required to distinguish one person from another, and to identify relationships between persons.
- The first component of a Children’s Social Care Taxonomy will define key concepts in children’s social care, and how they are described, but be limited in scope to those concepts needed to support the core use cases for Single View systems. 

### Standards Brief – Commissioning children’s care placements   

We will develop a standard which: 
- Allows groups of LAs (we assume regions) to create a shared picture of placement sufficiency – what provision do they need, where, and available at what notice – and how does this compare to what they have available to the now.
- Enables them to make sufficiently like-for-like comparisons of placement cost.
- Enables them to forecast future demand for commercially meaningful types of service
- Represents the smallest possible burden on frontline staff
- Represents the smallest cost of change for regions
- Does not require any change from the case management suppliers.

We will also develop a package of implementation support for regions adopting this.

We will not be attempting to create a standard for automating any part of the placement finding process, although people working on this may find parts of the standard useful, nonetheless.

We will not be attempting to create a single national referral form, or national contract. Those might be useful, but they are distinct from this work which 
has a tighter scope – simply creating a standard for the core data to be used in sufficiency analysis. 

We will not initially be attempting to cover placements in adult social care, although the work may extend to that in future.
