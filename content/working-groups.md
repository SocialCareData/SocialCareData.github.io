## What is a standards working group?

The aim of a standards working group is to ensure standards are developed that:​
- Meet the needs of all stakeholders.​
- Directly address requirements identified.​
- Are within the guardrails set by the steering group.​

The Standards Working Groups will: ​
- Own the enterprise data architecture and technical roadmaps required to enable open data standards to be
implemented and adopted by stakeholders. ​
- Research, recommend or create data standards that respond to the use cases. ​
- Commission the technical infrastructure required to implement the standards. ​
- Collaborate to test the standards and infrastructure delivered by the standardisation initiative to ensure it is operable and performant. ​
- Promote the adoption of the standards, supporting organisations in developing business cases for change. ​

We have created a standards working group for each use case.

## Meeting frequency and format
​We expect​:
- The MAIS Working Group will need to meet monthly.​
- The Placements Working Group will meet bi-monthly.​

We are running as an open group attendees may change as the project moves forwards.​

Meetings will be primarily held online.​

A shared workspace (on GitHub) will enable standards working groups to collaborate between meetings. ​

Meetings will be recorded (for administrative purposes only), with a short meeting summary and slides
published online.

## About GitHub
GitHub is a powerful online workspace where teams can store, manage, and collaborate on projects,
especially those involving computer code or other technical files.

We are using GitHub to:​
- Store our specifications​, in named folders (known as _repositories_ or repos)
- Track feedback on specifications (_issues_)​
- Have _Discussions_ to inform the development of standards​
- Openly share project documentation ​
- Host our initial project website​

In the future we will use GitHub to:​
- Host and manage the development of any infrastructure or tools we need to develop​
- Enable people to reuse our specifications and code​

We will work to keep this simple and provide guidance when needed.
