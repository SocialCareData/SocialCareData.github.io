# Use Case 2: Children's Care Placements

We will develop a standard which: 
- Allows groups of LAs (we assume regions) to create a shared picture of placement sufficiency – what provision do they need, where, and available at what notice – and how does this compare to what they have available to them now 
- Enables them to make sufficiently like-for-like comparisons of placement cost 
- Enables them to forecast future demand for commercially meaningful types of service 
- Represents the smallest possible burden on frontline staff 
- Represents the smallest cost of change for regions 
- Does not require any change from the case management suppliers 
- We will also develop a package of implementation support for regions adopting this.  

We will not yet be attempting to:
- Create a standard for automating any part of the placement finding process, although people working on this may find parts of the standard useful, nonetheless. 
- Cover placements in adult social care, although the work may extend to that in the future. 

We have no plans or mandate to create a single national referral form, or national contract. Those might be useful, but they are distinct from this work which has a tighter scope – simply creating a standard for the core data to be used in sufficiency analysis. 

We will build on what already exists. That means:
- Not duplicating anything already collected universally due to inclusion in statutory returns (e.g. the CLA Census) 
- Making good use of the work already done on regional standards through Placements Northwest, and the Southwest Sufficiency programme among others 
- Tying into the work being done on regional data sharing through Regional Innovation and Improvement Agencies, Combined Authorities, and Regional Care Cooperatives 
- Complementing in-depth strengths-based assessments such as the CANS, and bottom-up costing tools such as CareCubed. 

## The broken status quo
The market for children’s social care placements, referring to the accommodation and support provided to children when they are taken into the care of the local authority, has been described by the [Local Government Association](https:/www.local.gov.uk/about/news/childrens-social-care-placements-costing-ps10000-plus-rise-sharply-five-years-new-lga) as “broken”. Children are too often having to live far from home and in an institutional rather than family-like setting. There is also a very significant impact on Local Authorities’ budgets. 

Managing this market – essentially ensuring that the right provision is available in the right place and at the right notice – requires market intelligence. LAs must have a clear picture of supply and demand in order to be able to tell providers what new provision they would be likely to pay for, or to make decisions about where to invest their own funds. 

Because these markets are increasingly regional and national (particularly for children’s homes), that intelligence must be based on data from multiple LAs. 

Very few regions are able to do this at present. This is in part due to technical and information governance barriers, but these are increasingly being solved. A more stubborn challenge is that key data items are not captured in a standard way across LAs and so even where data can be shared, some of the most important questions cannot be answered. Fields subject to variations in definition include the services sought, the actual services provided, and the costs of placements. These are critical to sufficiency analysis. 

That is the problem we will tackle here – creating a data standard for describing placements which allows any region to answer its sufficiency questions, whilst placing the smallest burden on busy placement teams, and representing the smallest cost of change.
